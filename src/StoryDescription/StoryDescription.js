          Single page websites are great because they dynamically update as the
          <br />
          user interacts with application, thus allowing for shorter loading
          times
          <br />
          between pages. Although the page never actually reloads or sends you
          to
          <br />
          a new route, the app mimics this behavior by manipulating the windowâ€™s
          <br />
          history or location objects. Using a link to navigate to a new page
          with
          <br />
          is pretty straightforward: a user interacts with an element, and that
          <br />
          event triggers the history or location change. Redirecting proves to
          be
          <br />
          more difficult, as the routing action needs to be fired based on the
          <br />
          state of the application.
